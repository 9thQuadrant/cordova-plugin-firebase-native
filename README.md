# Complete Firebase Native SDK for Cordova

This plugin implements all of Firebase Native SDK available features for iOS, Android and Web without exclude nothing. Yes, we are talking about using the most popular like realtime database and up to FirebaseUI, AdMob, Invites, etc...

We are built for ambitious applications! We believe in an amazing future of productive development using tools like Cordova, Ionic, Firebase!

>*Note*: This is in initial phase of development, enjoy with us to make this an awesome plugin, focused in being a part of official google plugins like `angularfire2` and `emberfire`

Something went wrong? Give us to know right now, [open an Issue](issues/new) making this more better! :+1:
